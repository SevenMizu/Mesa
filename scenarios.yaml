# Policy scenario configurations for the Household Savings ABM.
#
# Four core scenarios to study different policy levers and their distributional effects:
# 1. Baseline: Status quo policies for US & UK (reference path)
# 2. Interest rate shock: Higher return on savings (+2 percentage points)
# 3. Tax incentive: More generous tax-favoured saving (stronger subsidy/match)
# 4. Auto-enrolment: Behavioural policy (automatic enrollment with default contribution)
#
# Households are initialised from SCF/WAS microdata. Each scenario shows emergent
# savings rates, wealth paths, and inequality across agents.

scenarios:
  baseline:
    description: |
      Status quo policies (US & UK).
      
      Reference scenario: households initialised from SCF/WAS with stylised
      "current regime" financial and policy parameters for each country.
      
      Purpose: gives a reference path for savings rates and wealth distributions,
      showing emergent inequality from heterogeneity + baseline institutional rules.
    
    US:
      tax_credit_rate: 0.0
      base_savings_rate: 0.1
      interest_rate: 0.02
    
    UK:
      auto_enroll: false
      mandatory_contrib_rate: 0.0
      interest_rate: 0.02

  interest_rate_shock:
    description: |
      Higher return on savings (baseline + 2 percentage points).
      
      Same institutional rules as baseline, but increased interest rate on savings.
      This is a pure financial-price change with no behaviour-rule modifications.
      
      Purpose: isolate how a price signal (return on savings) alters emergent aggregate
      savings, wealth accumulation paths, and inequality in US vs UK.
    
    US:
      tax_credit_rate: 0.0
      base_savings_rate: 0.1
      interest_rate: 0.04
    
    UK:
      auto_enroll: false
      mandatory_contrib_rate: 0.0
      interest_rate: 0.04

  tax_incentive:
    description: |
      More generous tax-favoured saving (tax break/subsidy/match).
      
      Same interest rate as baseline, but introduce or strengthen a tax incentive
      for long-term savings (e.g. higher effective return or contribution match up to a cap).
      This is a rule-based policy change, not a market-price change.
      
      Purpose: study how a policy targeted at savings rules (not prices) changes
      participation, wealth accumulation, and distributional outcomes across agents.
    
    US:
      tax_credit_rate: 0.20
      base_savings_rate: 0.1
      interest_rate: 0.02
    
    UK:
      auto_enroll: false
      mandatory_contrib_rate: 0.0
      interest_rate: 0.02

  auto_enrolment:
    description: |
      Behavioural policy shock: default automatic enrolment.
      
      Keep baseline financial parameters (interest rate, tax treatment), but change
      behavioural/institutional rules: automatic enrolment into a pension/savings plan
      with a default contribution rate, vs pure opt-in.
      This is a small micro-rule tweak with potentially large macro effects.
      
      Purpose: show emergent effects from defaults on participation rates,
      long-run savings accumulation, and wealth inequality.
    
    US:
      tax_credit_rate: 0.0
      base_savings_rate: 0.1
      interest_rate: 0.02
    
    UK:
      auto_enroll: true
      mandatory_contrib_rate: 0.05
      interest_rate: 0.02
